# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
  
  The purpose of this analysis was to analyze employment data to help Pewlett Hackard determine how many employees are retirement eligible per position title.  Then, with the gathered retirement data, a further anaylysis was taken to determine and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
  
## Results

  The following are four major points that can be concluded with the collected and sorted data:

  - Many titled employees are approaching retirement
    
    There is a total of 90,398 employees with titles that are within retirement eligibility.

  - Shortage of Managers
    
    With only a few managers total and some of them up for retirement, some thought may need to be put into hiring more, having managers in training, or having a thorough mentorship program for managers.
        
  - Senior Engineer and Senior Staff

    The titles of senior enginer has 29,414 employees eligible for retirement and senior staff has 28,252 - making them the most vulnerable titles to the loss of employees due to retirement.
    
   - Mentorship Eligibility

      There are well over 72,000 titled employees eligible for mentorship.
      
## Summary

  - How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

    Unless the company decides to downsize their number of employees, there are 90,398 employees that are within retirement range, with positions that will need to be filled.
    
  - Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

    According to the following information, there does seem to be enough retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation, depending on the ratio of mentor to mentee that the company would prefer. I created a series of tables, resulting in a final table "not_retiring_titles" to get the number of employees that are not retirement eligible and compared those numbers to the amount of employees that are eligible to become mentors. I got the number of mentors by creating the table "mentorship_eligibilty_count". 
    
    The departments with the highest mentee to mentor ratio are Senior Engineering at 15,782 mentors and 68,329 mentees and Senior Staff with 16,405 mentors and 64,589 mentees. Almost all other departments have a closer ratio of 50 percent, beside Technique Leader, which is closer to a 30 percent ratio of mentees to mentors.
