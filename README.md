# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
  
  The purpose of this analysis was to analyze employment data to help Pewlett Hackard determine how many employees are retirement eligible per position title.  Then, with the gathered retirement data, a further anaylysis was taken to determine and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
  
## Results

  The following are four major points that can be concluded with the collected and sorted data:

  - Many titled employees are approaching retirement
    
    There is a total of 90,398 employees with titles that are within retirement eligibility.

  - Shortage of Managers
    
    With only a few managers total and some of them up for retirement, some thought may need to be put into hiring more, having managers in training, or having a thorough mentorship program for managers.
        
  - Senior Engineer and Senior Staff

    The titles of senior enginer has 29,414 employees eligible for retirement and senior staff has 28,252 - making them the most vulnerable titles to the loss of employees due to retirement.
    
   - Mentorship Eligibility

      There are well over 72,000 titled employees eligible for mentorship.
